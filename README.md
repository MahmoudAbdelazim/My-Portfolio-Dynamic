# Mahmoud-Abdelazim-Portfolio
This is a dynamic version of my portfolio website.

Unlike the static version, this application pulls data from a back-end server that stores all my information in a database, and I've created an Admin dashboard to allow me to update any information in the website without the need to update the HTML statically.

The project is divided into three parts:

## 1- The Back-End Server
Used Spring Boot to create the back-end REST APIs that allows me to store and manipulate the data in the MySQL database.

## 2- The Admin Dashboard
Created an admin dashboard front-end in React.js that communicates with the backend server and allows me to update any information in the website without the need to update the database manually, this is a screenshot for the admin dashboard:

## 3- The Front-End
Created the front-end using React.js and Bootstrap that pulls the data from the back-end server and renders the information dynamically, this is a screenshot for the main front-end website:
